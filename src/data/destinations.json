      "description": "Ilam Tea Garden is the tea history of Nepal and hence the oldest tea garden (161 years old now). Ilam began tea cultivation in 1863 AD when the Chinese government sent tea saplings to Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana. It covers 49.5 hectares of land near Ilam bazaar. The Ilam orthodox tea with aromatic flavor is one of the best teas in the world. The roasting of tea leaves in machines began in Nepal after the establishment of a tea factory in 15/8 in Ilam.",

It is a boon that the tea garden and Ilam Municipality always complement each other offering employment to the tea pluckers and factory workers and green gem of tea garden recreation and sightseeing to the visitors."
